    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    ```
* The main target creates a simulator of the game that can be played in console.
* The test target creates a program with various commands that can be run, including random simulation
* Click the star button at the top of the repo :)

**Build tips**
* If your build fails with an error about not-return-only `constexpr` methods, ensure your compiler supports c++17.
